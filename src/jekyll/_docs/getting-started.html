<p>
  Getting up and running with Shubox was designed to be quick and easy so you can get up back to working on your project. There are two parts to setting up
  Shubox — connecting your Amazon S3 account to Shubox, then integrating Shubox
  into your website. Let’s go!
</p>

<h2 class="mt4 mb0" id="setup-amazon">Amazon S3 Setup</h2>

<p>
  In order for Shubox to work it’s magic, it needs access to your Amazon S3
  account with a few non-destructive permissions.
</p>

<h3 class="mt4 mb0">Step 1: Create an "Identity and Access Management" (IAM) User</h3>

<p>
  Amazon's user management service "Identity and Access Management" (IAM), is how
  master AWS accounts manage users, groups, and the permissions to work with the
  different services. We would recommend that each site (and with further
  granularity - each domain) that works with Shubox to be an IAM user. Let’s make
  one:
</p>

<h4 class="mt4">
  Head over to the “Users” section of your
  <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users">AWS console</a>
  and hit the “Add user” button:
</h4>

<figure class="shadow">
  <img src="/assets/1-user-dashboard.png" alt="user dashboard"/>
</figure>

<h4>We suggest creating a “shubox” user with programatic access:</h4>

<figure class="shadow">
  <img src="/assets/2-add-user.png" alt="add user"/>
</figure>

<h4>Attach the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy, then review and create the user:</h4>

<figure class="shadow">
  <img src="/assets/3-permissions.png" alt="set permissions"/>
</figure>

<p>
  Not comfortable with granting Shubox full permissions? That’s okay, we only
  need following permissions to do our work:
  <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketGET.html">
    <code>s3:ListBucket</code>
  </a>
  <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUT.html">
    <code>s3:CreateBucket</code>
  </a>
  <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTcors.html">
    <code>s3:PutBucketCORS</code>
  </a>
  <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTcors.html">
    <code>s3:PutObject</code>
  </a>
</p>

<h4 class="mt4">Review and create the user:</h4>

<figure class="shadow">
  <img src="/assets/4-review.png" alt="review and create user"/>
</figure>

<h4>Grab your access key id and secret access key:</h4>

<figure class="shadow">
  <img src="/assets/5-success.png" alt="great success"/>
</figure>

<h2 id="setup-shubox">Connect Your Domain to Shubox</h2>

<p>
  Step 2: Now that your Amazon IAM user is set up, you can head over to your Shubox
  dashboard and <a href="https://dashboard.shubox.io/domains/new">add a new domain</a>. A
  unique bit of JavaScript will be created for your domain. You’re going to need
  that next.
</p>

<h2 class="mt4" id="setup-website">Website Integration</h2>

<p>
  It’s time to fire up your editor! We’re going to connect your website to
  Shubox. Place the javascript snippet that shubox provided just before
  <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> in your HTML template:
</p>

<pre class="html"><code>
    ...
    &lt;script src="/x/abc12300.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 class="mt4">Initialization</h2>

<p>
  Now all we have to do is bind Shubox to a form element:
</p>

<pre class="html"><code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt;
  // with no options
  new Shubox("#dragndrop");

  // with custom options - note: `optionKey` is just an example
  new Shubox("#dragndrop", { optionKey: 'option value' });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 class="mt4">Customization</h2>

<p>
  From here you can use our <a href="#javascript-api">JavaScript API</a> to
  create the file uploader of your dreams. If you’d rather get started fast,
  check out our <a href="/demos">example/demo uploaders</a> here or on <a
  href="http://codepen.io/shubox">codepen</a>. Feel free to incorporate those
  into your project, customize them, or use them to learn the ropes.
</p>

<h2 class="mt4" id="local-dev-with-sandboxes">Local Development with <em>Development Sandboxes</em></h2>

<p>
  To make local development as <em>"quick to victory"</em> as possible we've
  created what we call <em>development sandboxes</em>. To view the installation
  instructions for your own account,
  <a href="https://dashboard.shubox.io/domains/sandbox">visit your dashboard
  and follow the steps outlined there</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Development Sandboxes are S3 buckets we've created, for you, under our own
  Shubox umbrella that are configured for immediate use with the usual
  development addresses:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>localhost:*</code></li>
  <li><code>127.0.0.1:*</code></li>
  <li><code>0.0.0.0:*</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> sandboxes are for quickly testing the JavaScript
  library and getting a feel for how Shubox file uploads work and feel. Image
  transforms are not enabled for the sandbox. To test image transforms you would
  have to set up a specific domain for your environment(s).
</p>

<h2 class="mt4" id="setup-image-transforms">Image Transforms</h2>

<p>
  Image transforms are operations defined in the dashboard that occur on all
  images uploaded through your configured Shubox element.  An image transform
  consists of 1 or more <em>processes</em> where you define
  <strong>what</strong> happens to an image after it is uploaded. That could be
  a single new image size created, several different image sizes, or more.
</p>

<h3 class="mt4 mb0">Available Image Transforms Processes</h3>

<p>
  Currently:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Resize images</strong> using <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry">the geometry conventions with ImageMagick</a>. Currently supported geometries:

    <ul>
      <li><code>300</code> - resize to width.</li>
      <li><code>x400</code> - resize to height.</li>
      <li><code>340x400</code> - max width and height.</li>
      <li><code>340x400^</code> - minimum width and height.</li>
      <li><code>340x400#</code> - cropped to this size.</li>
      <li><code>340x400!</code> - explicitly this size.</li>
      <li><code>340x400&gt;</code> - shrink if larger than size.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Optimize JPGs and PNGs</strong> using, advpng, gifsicle,
    jpegoptim, jpegtran, optipng, pngcrush, pngquant, and pngout.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Convert JPGs and PNGs</strong> to WebP format.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Convert animated gifs</strong> to MP4, WebM, or both!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Auto-orient rotation</strong> in photos (usually) taken with cell phone cameras.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Strip EXIF data</strong> from uploaded photos.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Extract single frame</strong> from the middle of an animated gif.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="mt4 mb0">New Files Resulting From Image Transforms</h2>

<p>
After images are uploaded to S3 and are put through the assigned image transform process
queue, the resulting files are uploaded back to S3 alongside the original file in the same, original, directory.
The resulting files are named with a prefix according to the process applied to them. The prefixes related to the above
processes are.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>ORIGINAL.JPG</code></strong>. The original file, if the
    auto-orient or EXIF stripping processes are applied, will remain the same
    but will have either/or process applied.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>[Provided Imagemagick Geometry]_ORIGINAL.JPG</code></strong>.
    Where <em>"Provided Imagemagick Geometry"</em> is what was assigned for the
    value(s) under "Image Sizes".  Eg: <em>100x100!</em> would result in
    <strong><em>100x100!_ORIGINAL.JPG</em></strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>frame_ORIGINAL.gif</code></strong>. Animated gifs that have a
    frame extracted will have a <em>frame_</em> prefix.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="mt4 mb0">Setting Up an Image Transform Queue</h2>

<h3 class="mt4 mb0">Step 1: A functional Shubox upload</h3>

<p>
  Step one is to make sure <a href="#setup-website">you have a functional Shubox
  element</a> accepting uploads to your bucket.
</p>

<h3 class="mt4 mb0">Step 2: Set up the image transform in your dashboard</h3>

<p>
  In your dashboard, <a href="https://dashboard.shubox.io/image_transforms/new"
  target="_new">create a new image transform</a>. Give it a name, select the
  domains that should be able to run the transform, and select the processes and
  image sizes that should be generated after images are uploaded. Save your image
  transform and you are almost there. Last, but not least ...
</p>

<h3 class="mt4 mb0">Step 3: Update your Shubox element's HTML</h3>

<p>
  For Shubox to know that any uploadable element must put <em>each</em>
  uploaded image through the image transform queue that you have defined above,
  you must initialize your <code>Shubox</code> JavaScript object with the
  <code>transformName</code> option being assigned the name of the image
  transform you have created in the dashboard.
</p>

<p>
  Here is an example, with HTML and JS, <strong><em>before</em></strong>
  setting up an image transform:
</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;div id=&quot;avatar&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  new Shubox(&quot;#avatar&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
  And if we've <a href="https://dashboard.shubox.io/image_transforms/new" target="_blank">created an image transform</a> called "avatar-transforms", we would
  enable it with the following:
</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;div id=&quot;avatar&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  new Shubox(&quot;#avatar&quot;, { transformName: &quot;avatar-transforms&quot; });
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<h2 class="mt4" id="plan-limits">Plan Details</h2>

<p>
  There are some limitations based on what plan you are using. If you have an
  account in our app you are using our <strong>FREE</strong> plan. With it you
  get:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unlimited support for domains you set up with Shubox</li>
  <li>500 event credits per month, where:</li>
  <li>An uploaded file/image is 1 credit</li>
  <li>The processors used in image transforms each count as one credit. EG: A
  transform with 3 image resizes count as 3 credits every time an image is
  uploaded and run through that transform queue.</li>
  <li>Uploaded files are capped at 3 megabytes</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The Uptick plan is the same as the above except you get:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>2,500 event credits per month</li>
  <li>Uploaded files are capped at 20 megabytes</li>
</ul>

<p>
  And the Up Up &amp; Away plan:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>10,000 event credits per month</li>
  <li>Uploaded files are capped at 20 megabytes</li>
  <li>New pro/premium/super-duper features will roll out for all "Up, Up &amp;
    Away" plan subscribers first &mdash; <em>because "thank you" for your support</em>!</li>
</ul>
