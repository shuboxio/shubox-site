Last week I sent the following email out to customers, colleagues, supporters
and advisors:

> Hello there,
> 
> I truly hope that this email finds you well.
> 
> If you're getting this email you are currently, or have been, a user, a
> customer, or a supporter of the Shubox service. Shubox is an app that adds a
> "nice" layer on top of the Amazon Web Services S3 to make uploading files to
> S3 easier.
> 
> I'm here to share the news that I plan on shutting Shubox down at the end of
> the year. It's been a truly wonderful ride these last 10 (or so) years and I
> wouldn't change a thing about the experience. I've been candid and honest
> elsewhere about what the journey has been like, but as with most things
> learning hard lessons is often the product of difficult, challenging, trying
> experiences.
> 
> The decision to shut things down has been in the back of my mind for several
> years and I am finally at peace with the prospect of closing these doors.
> It's time to concentrate on myself, my family, and the long list of things
> that "fill my cup" instead of the things I feel I should or need to do.
> 
> *** 
> 
> What does this mean for you?
> 
>  • Most everyone here hosts their own S3 bucket. This will remain yours,
>    forever. Your files are yours and I will do nothing with them. No deleting.
>    Nothing. 
>  • We will work with anyone who's had Shubox-provisioned buckets move all
>    objects to your own S3 Bucket.
>  • I will work with anyone who needs guidance on how to move forward with
>    transitioning from the Shubox infrastructure to a new solution.
>  • I will be sending an email at the end of both October and November, with a
>    report on how many files are being uploaded, transformed, etc. This email
>    will act as a reminder that Shubox will shut down on New Year's eve,
>    December 31, 2025. (I hope this is enough lead time to make the transition.
>
> If you have any questions, or need to work with me on timing, please respond
> to this email directly. It'll come right to me.
> 
> I cannot thank you enough for your time, your trust, your collaboration, your
> support, and your interest.
> 
> 🙏🏼️

And I have written more about this on my personal website at [joeloliveira.com], 
in case you're interested in some further perspective. It's been a wonderful ride. 
I wouldn't change a thing. Thank you.
