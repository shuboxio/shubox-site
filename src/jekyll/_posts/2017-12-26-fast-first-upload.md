  To get an application or website to a point where integrating Shubox
  is with as little fuss as possible - we've set up a pre-fab "sandbox" S3
  bucket for you to use.

_Setting up an S3 bucket before using Shubox - no longer required!_

As a developer who uses more than their fair share of services as a means to shave
time off from doing _task X_ in order to get _feature Y_ done, I know what it means
to get to a _*win*_ as fast as possible. Push-button successes, right? The nice
touches that get you to "done".

In light of that, Shubox has put together a "sandbox" bucket that can be used
_immediately_ with your local development environment upon registering your
account. You no longer need to get your S3 bucket ready to go in order to test
the main Shubox functionality. As long as your local app/web server is running
on <code>localhost</code>/<code>127.0.0.1</code>/<code>0.0.0.0</code> then you're
ready to get started.

All that's left is to place our javascript library in your html, and hook Shubox into your element(s). Done.
