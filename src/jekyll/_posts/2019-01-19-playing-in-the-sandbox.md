As developers we know that one of the most critical things to adoption is in
the process of onboarding. How fast can you get to a point where you're
thinking - "Oh okay now I get it"? How much friction can you offload on
the people who are coming in to try your tool or product?

This was the impetus that led us to create the "sandbox" feature in Shubox.
The sandbox provides a way to play with the JavaScript library _without having
to_ set up an S3 bucket for the express purpose of trying it out. If you haven't
yet created an IAM user, or S3 bucket, or want to merely kick the tires on our
application without setting things up - this is your chance to do so.

Let's check out how easy this is to do. First, the pre-requisites:

* [Sign up for an account](https://dashboard.shubox.io/sign_up).
* [Go to your own sandbox page](https://dashboard.shubox.io/domains/sandbox) and grab the Sandbox Key.

That's it.

Not so bad, right?
