Happy holidays! Guess what? I have a gift for you (sort of). More on that
shortly. Before we get to that, though, let's talk a little bit about needs and
motivation.

It's been several years since I wrote the first line of code for Shubox. From
that first hacking session until today my goal has always been to make
something that would be useful to me, and people like me &mdash; people who
work on the web. It's always been, first and foremost, a scratch of my own
itch.  To that point I feel that I've succeeded. I use Shubox *all* the damn
time.

When I would work on client projects and the need to upload, resize, do much
with AWS S3, then I would suggest using Shubox and be done with it. It worked.
It saved me a tremendous amount of time. For those clients, it was also
ultimately _free_! Most of their use cases were esspecialy unique and I was
able to learn a lot about what my they needed vis a vis Shubox. The trade
&mdash; feedback for service.

It was an easy justification because most of these clients weren't in need high
volume file or image uploading. As a result a conversation similar to "You
know, I have this service that you should pay $49 a month for. Yes, to upload a
few photos for the 3 or 4 products you add to your catalog every month" never
happened.

In a business's lifecycle there are long stretches where needs evolve.
Coming out of the gates for an initial launch usually doesn't _need_ a
Kubernetes cluster, distributed messaging systems, hadoop, tensorflow, bloopity
bloop, whatever. A few dynos on Heroku, droplets on DigitalOcean, or VPS's on
Linode should be ok. Exception handling, google analytics, Sendgrid, and maybe
a Squarespace account would round out a lot of the first absolute must-haves.

Most of those things have something in common. You can start out using them for
free. Of course some of the leading services people could reach for in Shubox's
space also have free tiers.

I won't belabor the point - Shubox _should_ have a free tier. Shubox is something
that people with low usage, or are just starting out, _should_ be able to use for
a while to see if it's right for them. This much is true.

As a result, as of today, anyone who signs up for an account on Shubox will be
able _to use it free, forever_, or until they need more, bigger, better service.

Merry Christmas! Happy Chanukah! Happy Kwanzaa! And a lovely Festivus for the
rest of us.
